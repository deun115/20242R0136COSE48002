    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - assets/images/
        - .env

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: Pretendard
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Regular.otf
                weight: 400
              - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Medium.otf
                weight: 500
              - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-SemiBold.otf
                weight: 600
              - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Bold.otf
                weight: 700
